## Experiment-11-programming-logic-device-s-FPGA-BOARDS

## AIM: 
To understand the standard procedure to interface an FPGA board and flashing method using usb blaster. 

## HARDWARE REQUIRED:  
â€“ PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   
Quartus prime

## THEORY: 
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

## PROCEDURE:

1. Start the Quartus II Programmer.
